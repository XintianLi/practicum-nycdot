### Chelsea & East Harlem

In the part, we select two neighborhoods to see their bike ridership
trends in July 2018 and 2019. The first neighborhood is Chelsea, and the
second is East Harlem. Chelsea lies on the west side of Manhattan
borough. It is a typical representative of Manhattan, which has a high
density built environment, large population, and highly diversed art and
culture. East Harlem is more residential, we pick this neighborhood
because it may be more similar to other residential boroughs in the NYC.

We use trip data in July for this part, because that weather in July is
most suitable for biking.

First, Letâ€™s see the ridership trend by hour and by day. As shown in the
plots below, ridership in both neighborhood increase from 2018 to 2019.
The ridership in Chelsea is much higher than that in East Harlem and the
daily peaks are more obvious. Also, the frequency of bike use in a month
increase.

shows the hourly ridership in a day. This plot shows that in Chelsea,
the morning peak hour is around 11 am and the night peak hour is around
10 pm. The daily periodicity become more obvious in 2019, which may
indicate that more people use bike to commute to work in their daily
life. However, although the ridership in East Harlem also increase,
there is no obvious periodicity.

study the ridership changes in two boroughs seperately.

This graph compares the ridership in Chelsea in two years. As you can
see, the increase of ridership mainly happens in the south west part of
the neighborhood. For example, the west 22 ST had a monthly ridership of
1020 in 2019. The riverside roads also see an obvious increase in these
two years.
