# Project Management Plan

### What is the use case? Why is this important?
The task is to help New York City Department of Transportation prioritize streets for the addition of bike lanes. Using bikeshare route data, we will analyze how ridership on a street has changed after the addition of a bike lane. They want us to calculate a score for each street in their network indicating how impactful it would be to add a bike lane to that street. 
### What are your exploratory analysis questions?
- Which streets had a bike lane added in 2018-2020?
- What is our unit of analysis for time? (year? month? think seasonal changes)
- What is the ridership change before/after a specific bike lane was added?
- What other factors affect ridership?
### Questions about the method: 
- How will we calculate ‘ridership’ on a street?
	- Initial thoughts: do an intersect
		- But it will probably need to be buffered since people don’t bike on the centerline
		- How do we repeat that for every street
		- What if the before and after periods are of different length

### What are the team roles?
- We all want to contribute to the markdown, but we will split up tasks as they arise
- We will decide on other roles or tasks as we move forward

### Gantt chart:


### Questions for the client?
- Can we have all 4 (a, b, c, d) releases of LION from 2018-2020?
- What do the levels of the BikeLane column indicate?
